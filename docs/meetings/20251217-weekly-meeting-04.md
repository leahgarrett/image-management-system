## Summary

### Backend Tech Stack Decision Meeting

The team discussed backend technology options, with Node, Python, and Go being considered for microservices, while Python was suggested for handling image metadata due to its extensive libraries. They agreed to keep the backend as Node to support the backend and data upload functionality, while React was chosen for the frontend due to its popularity and support for file uploads. The team decided to research available libraries for their features and investigate the flexibility of each technology stack before making final decisions. They also considered implementing an ingestion API with one or more microservices behind it to handle tasks like thumbnail creation and metadata extraction.

### AI Coding Tools and Future Implications

The team discussed using AI coding assistance, with Fabs and Laura expressing openness to trying it while acknowledging the need for human oversight due to potential output quality issues. 

### Project Updates 

The team discussed project updates and task allocations, with Leah confirming she would post the next meeting details in the channel. They also talked about updating the architecture/solution overview document to include user flows and other relevant documentation into a single summary document. Laura shared her experience with project management tools, particularly GitHub projects, and emphasized the importance of clear communication in remote work environments. The conversation concluded with plans to schedule the next project meeting for Wednesday, 7th January.
