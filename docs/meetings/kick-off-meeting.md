# Image Management System  
## Project Kickoff

---

## Welcome

**People**  
• Leah  
• Iryna  
• Tech Leading Ladies collaborators  

**Purpose of the session**  
• Align on what we are building  
• Share early thinking  
• Invite contributions  
• Plan the next steps

---

## Project Objectives

• Experience the full project lifecycle  
• Build a lightweight system to organise and search images and videos  
• Keep it simple, flexible and easy to evolve  
• Make space for people to contribute in planning or hands on work

---

## The Problem

• Images and videos live across drives, devices and folders  
• Hard to browse, search or curate  
• No shared way to tag or describe items  
• Hard to reuse when creating content or sharing

---

## The Vision

A simple system that:  
• indexes media and metadata  
• allows fast search and filtering  
• supports tagging and descriptions  
• grows over time without heavy tooling

---

## Target Audience

• Individual collectors  
• Small communities  
• Future shared archives  
• Anyone interested in contributing to the project

---

## Feature Ideation (MVP)

• Extract metadata from existing files  
• Generate a clean JSON or database index  
• Browse and search UI  
• Add tags and descriptions  
• Keep the workflow simple

---

## Feature Ideas (Later Versions)

• AI tagging and advanced search  
• Face or object detection  
• Video thumbnails and search  
• Roles and permissions  
• Collaboration and review workflow  
• Cloud or device sync

---

## Technical Direction (Early Thinking)

**Frontend**  
• React based browser UI  
• Simple search and filter experience

**Backend / Utilities**  
• Node or Go utilities  
• Metadata extraction  
• JSON index or lightweight database

**Storage**  
• Local folders or external drive  
• Clear directory structure

---

## Technical Spikes

Short investigations to inform decisions:  
• Metadata extraction  
• Search library options  
• Folder and storage structure  
• Index format (JSON vs DB)  
• Preview thumbnails

---

## How We Work Together

• GitHub repo for code and documentation  
• Markdown based docs  
• Dedicated Slack channel  
• Casual contributions welcome  
• Planning sessions as needed

---

## Next Steps

• Identify small tasks to explore  
• Decide what needs refinement  
• Start early spikes  
• Plan the first milestone

---

## Thank You

• Keen to hear ideas and input  
• Everyone welcome to contribute  
• Notes and updates will live in the repo
